# GIT MyCheatSheet
* Git config
> 
* Git config
>
* git init

* add untracked files to the staging area. Files are ready to be committed

```
> git add <file>
```


* get info about current workin tree and staging area
>> git status

* commit to save changes to git directory
>> git commit -m "message"

* tracked (old but modified files)/untracked files (NEW FIles)
>>

* check the config of a git repo
>> git config -l

### Using git locally

* Skipping the staging area/skip the [git add] step
>> git commit -a {shortcut for fiels which are already part of staging area}

* check the logs/history
>> git log

* to see the actual lines of change in git commit [use patch option -p flag]
* we can quickly see what lines were changed
>> git log -p

* git show a particular commit
>> git show <commitId>

* --stat flag: which files were changed, how many lines were added or removed
>> git --stat

* to keep track of the changes made to the code, we use diff command
* git diff shows only unstaged changes by default
>> git diff <file>  OR git diff

* to see the staged changes which are not committed yet
>> git diff --staged

* Review chnages before adding them. Stage the changes with -p flag
>> git add -p

* Delete and rename files *

* remove files form git directory
>> git rm <file>
>> git commit -m "file deleted"

* rename files in the git repo/ move files between two directories
>> git mv file_old file_new
>> git commit -m  "renamed file"

* .gitignore[ignore files which are automatically generated by the OS and create noise in our git repo]
>> echo .DS_STORE > .gitignore
>> git add .gitignore
>> git commit -m "added files to be ignored"

* Revert changes in git [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things] * 

* Revert the changes in a file to an original version
>> git checkout <file>

* revert staged changes in the code
>> git reset HEAD <file which needs to be removed from the staged area>

* Amending commits/fix the description in commit. Only fix local commits
>> git commit --ammend

* Rollbacks. Undone changes.
>> git revert HEAD <filename>{reverts the current version of code }
>> git revert <commitID>

* Git branches: A pointer to a particular commit. Default brach is Master. * 

* Check for the branches:
>> git branch  [checks for the branches]

* creates new branch
>> git branch <newBranchName> [creates new branch]

* switch to the new branch
>> git checkout <newBranchName> [switch to new branch]

* create and switch to the new branch altogether
>> git checkout -b <newBranch2> [creates and switches to the new branch]

* delete a branch
>> git branch -d <branch>
* forcibly deletes a branch
>> got branch -D <branchName>

-- Merging: combines the data and history together
>> git merge

- If there are merge conflicts (meaning files are incompatible), --abort can be used to abort the merge action.
>> git merge --abort

- two merge algorithms: fast-forward and 3-way merge

- see commits as graph, only one line per commit. This shows a summarized view of the commit history for a repo.
>> git log --graph --oneline

- GitHub
- make an account on GitHub
-- Setting up git.credentials ... to automate the git push/ pull without the need of password
> brew install git
> brew tap microsoft/git [Enter username and password in the GUI]
> brew install --cask git-credential-manager-core

-- Workflow steps to work with remote repository
-> modify -> stage -> commit -> fetch -> merge -> push

> git clone
> git remote -v [get URLs to fetch and push from remote repo]

- get info about the origin of the remote repo
> git remote show origin

> look at the remote repo our git is tracking
- git branch -r

- Typical workflow with our remote git repo
> pull > merge > push

- git status gives the info about our remote repo as well

- downloads specific objects
>> git fetch

- fetches most up-to-date objects
>> git remote update

- describe a single remote repository
>> git remote show <repoName>

- List remote repos verbosely
>> git remote -v

- List remote repos
>> git remote

- List remote branches
>> git branch -r

- create branch repo on you local repo and switch to that repo
>> git checkout -b <branchName>

- git rebase
